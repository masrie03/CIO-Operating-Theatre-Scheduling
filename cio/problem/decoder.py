"""Decoder: permutation -> Schedule.

The default decoder is greedy first-fit. Surgeries are processed in the order
specified by the permutation; for each surgery, the decoder tries to find a
feasible (day, OT, team) triple and assigns the surgery to it if found.

The decoder is pluggable. Students who wish to design alternative decoders
(e.g., look-ahead, urgency-aware re-ordering, or partial-infeasibility
allowing decoders) can subclass `BaseDecoder` and pass their decoder to the
problem class.

Constraints handled in-decoder (always feasible by construction):
- OT daily hours
- OT specialty and equipment matching
- Team specialty matching
- Team daily hours
- Team consecutive-day limit
- ICU and ward daily capacities (when overflow_allowed=False)
- earliest_day respected

If `overflow_allowed=True`, the decoder permits ICU/ward overflow but the
overflow is captured by the resource-imbalance objective.
